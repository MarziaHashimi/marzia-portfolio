# Marzia Hashimi | Portfolio

This is my personal front-end developer portfolio built using **HTML** and **CSS** only. It highlights my skills, projects, experience, and contact information in a clean, animated, and responsive layout.

## 🎨 Theme & Inspiration

My theme is a blend of **professional minimalism with a creative touch**. I was inspired to reflect my identity as a front-end developer from Afghanistan by using soft animations, a light/dark mode toggle, and a calm layout that feels welcoming and user-friendly.

## 💡 Design Decisions

- Used only HTML and CSS to showcase my layout and styling skills without relying on JavaScript.
- Implemented a **light/dark mode switcher** using pure CSS.
- Added a **flying airplane button** to scroll back to top for user-friendly navigation.
- Presented projects visually using cards with images and live links.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced

- Creating the **dark/light mode switcher** using just CSS was a bit tricky, especially when managing colors across different sections.
- Designing the **airplane scroll-to-top button** and placing **moving clouds** behind it required extra effort in positioning and animation.
